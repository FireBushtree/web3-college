# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes Ignition modules to deploy the contracts. You can deploy these modules to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

#### Deploy OWC Token only

To deploy only the OWC Token contract:

```shell
# Local deployment
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/OWCToken.ts

# Sepolia deployment
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/OWCToken.ts
```

#### Deploy both OWC Token and Course Registry

To deploy both contracts (OWC Token will be deployed first, then Course Registry):

```shell
# Local deployment
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/CourseRegistry.ts

# Sepolia deployment
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/CourseRegistry.ts
```

#### Setting up Sepolia deployment

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```
